My first web game made through HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The player can use the **A** and **D** keys or **‚üµ** and **‚ü∂** arrow keys to move. This is also playable through mobile devices.

## Why did you build this?
I wanted to challenge myself and further improve my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also to have fun.
 
## What did you learn from this?
I learned and improved my fundamentals around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I learned about some new functionalities such as animation within CSS, using custom images and properly sizing such images, using custom fonts, and much more through JavaScript game development.
